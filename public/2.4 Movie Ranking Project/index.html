<h1>The Best Anime According to Antony</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 anime of all-time</h2><br />
<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>My number 1 favortie anime is this newly animated show has an unpredicatable ending that is not like any other anime</p>

<h3>Death Note</h3>
<p>This is probably why I got into anime, it is dark and has a very unique story line where the protagonist is also the antagonist.</p>

<h3>Monster</h3>
<p>One of the older animes but still has a soild long story where the main character has regret a decesion he made and is on the road to make right to his wrong</p>
